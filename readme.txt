Dopamenu
A dopamenu is a selection of activities that can be done to help increase the dopamine in your brain. This is my dopamenu, customized to my needs and activities that work for me.

Just like it is hard to make good food choices when you're starving, it can be hard to make good dopamine choices when you're bored. I created this dopamenu to provide easy access to activities that can help me get the mental stimulation I need. This allows me to stay on task, and work towards my own personal goals.

I learned about the concept of a Dopamenu from a YouTube video "How to Give Your Brain the Stimulation it Needs" on the How to ADHD channel. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6WCkTwW6xg
