# Dopamenu
Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter that plays a role in many functions of our bodies and minds. Most adults I know have found themselves stuck in a dopamine seeking cycle of social media scrolling, when their time would be better spent on a more fulfilling activity. 

Selecting that more fulfilling activity can be difficult if you're already low on dopamine. A dopamenu is a tool to assist with selecting more fulfilling free time activities, as well as side activities to help power through otherwise boring tasks. 

This website is my customized dopamenu geared towards my own goals and activities that work for me.

## Features
* In mobile the menu collapses down to an accordion, where each content section can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the section name (main course, appetizer, etc).
* Used media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two column desktop layout.
* Flexbox was used to make the two column layout responsive to different screen size, and to rearrange the order of the content when on desktop. On mobile the main course section is before the sauces and sides section, but on desktop the main course section is after the sauces and sides section.
* Used ":nth child" CSS to style the bullet points on unordered lists to alternate between circle and disk.

The concept of a dopamenu came from Eric Tivers in a conversation with Jessica McCabe. That discussion ["How to Give Your Brain the Stimulation It Needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6WCkTwW6xg) can be watched on youtube.
